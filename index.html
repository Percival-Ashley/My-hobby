      <p>
        Coding is my favorite hobby because it allows me to be creative while
        solving real-world problems. I enjoy the process of turning ideas into
        functional applications and learning new programming languages and tools
        along the way. It challenges my thinking, improves my focus, and gives
        me a sense of accomplishment every time I build something that works.
        Whether it's developing a simple script or a complex web application,
        coding keeps me engaged and constantly learning. I love the community
        aspect as well, where I can share my projects, get feedback, and
        collaborate with others who share the same passion.
